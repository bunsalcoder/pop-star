# Game Over Reset Fix

## Issue Fixed:
When the game is over and the user clicks "OK", it was resetting to Level 1 with score 0 but using the old star layout instead of generating a fresh random layout.

## Root Cause:
The `gameOverAlert` function was calling `initializeGameWithData()` without parameters, which would try to load the old star layout from the API instead of generating a fresh one.

## Solution Applied:

### 1. **Added `resetGame()` Function**
```javascript
async function resetGame() {
  console.log('Resetting game with fresh layout');
  totalScore = 0;
  currentLevel = 1;
  levelCleared = false;
  
  // Initialize with fresh random layout
  await initializeGameWithData(null, true);
  
  // Save the fresh layout to API
  try {
    const freshStarLayout = squareSet.map(row => row.map(sq => sq ? sq.num : null));
    await gameAPI.saveGameData({
      highLevel,
      highScore,
      level: currentLevel,
      score: totalScore,
      starLayout: freshStarLayout,
      levelCleared: false
    });
    console.log('Fresh game layout saved to API');
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Failed to save fresh game layout:', e);
  }
}
```

### 2. **Updated `gameOverAlert()` Function**
```javascript
// Before:
initializeGameWithData(); // Would load old layout

// After:
await resetGame(); // Generates fresh layout and saves it
```

## What This Fixes:

### **Before:**
1. Game over → Click "OK" → Level 1, Score 0, **Old star layout**

### **After:**
1. Game over → Click "OK" → Level 1, Score 0, **Fresh random star layout**

## Expected Behavior Now:

1. **Game over occurs** → "Game over!" alert shows
2. **Click "OK"** → Game resets to Level 1
3. **Score resets to 0** ✅
4. **Level resets to 1** ✅
5. **Fresh random star layout** ✅ (NEW!)
6. **Layout saves to API** ✅ (NEW!)

The game will now properly reset with a completely fresh star layout when starting over after game over!
