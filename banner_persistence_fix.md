# Banner Persistence Fix

## Issue Fixed:
The "Stage Cleared!" banner was vanishing after refresh even when the current score was above the target score.

## Root Cause:
The banner display logic was only checking for `levelCleared && totalScore >= getTargetScore()`, but the `levelCleared` flag wasn't being set properly when the game loaded with a score above target.

## Solution Applied:

### 1. **Enhanced Banner Display Logic**
```javascript
// Before: Only showed banner if levelCleared was true
if (levelCleared && totalScore >= getTargetScore()) {
  showLevelClearedBanner();
}

// After: Shows banner if score is above target, regardless of levelCleared flag
if (totalScore >= getTargetScore()) {
  if (!levelCleared) {
    levelCleared = true;
    saveGameDataOnLevelComplete(); // Save to API
  }
  showLevelClearedBanner();
}
```

### 2. **Automatic State Saving**
- When banner is shown, `levelCleared` is automatically set to `true`
- The state is immediately saved to the API
- This ensures persistence across refreshes

### 3. **Robust Level Completion Check**
- Enhanced `checkForLevelCompletion()` function
- Checks for both new completions and re-showing existing banners
- Handles edge cases where banner might be hidden

## Expected Behavior Now:

1. **Reach target score** → Banner shows immediately
2. **Refresh the page** → Banner persists (no more vanishing)
3. **Click banner** → Move to next level
4. **New level loads** → Fresh layout with correct target score

## Key Changes:

### Banner Display Logic (`initializeGameWithData`)
- ✅ Shows banner when `totalScore >= getTargetScore()`
- ✅ Automatically sets `levelCleared = true` if not already set
- ✅ Saves state to API immediately

### Level Completion Check (`checkForLevelCompletion`)
- ✅ Handles both new completions and existing cleared levels
- ✅ Re-shows banner if it was hidden
- ✅ Saves state to API when level is cleared

The banner should now persist correctly after refresh when the score is above the target!
